## Abstract
**Sentient** is an advanced AI humanization engine designed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and human communication. It transforms robotic, sterile outputs into natural, flowing text and developer-friendly code.

## 🚀 Sentient Engine
The core of this project is the **Sentient Engine**. It provides:

### 📝 Text Humanization
*   **Casual Tone**: Injects personality, slang, and conversational flow.
*   **Professional Tone**: Ensures polish and clarity without the "AI accent".
*   **Storytelling**: Weaves narratives for engaging content.

### 💻 Code Humanization
*   **Standard**: Refactors code to look hand-written (varies styles, adds minor imperfections).
*   **Debug Mode**: Automatically adds console logs for troubleshooting.
*   **Commented**: Adds helpful, human-readable comments explaining the logic.

## Motivation
As AI becomes ubiquitous, the need for "human" touch in digital interactions grows. **Sentient** restores the warmth and nuance often lost in machine generation.
